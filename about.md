<p>[CHz is a] self-described nerd with a keen hatred for computers. I sometimes use this as
a joke with the crude punchline of "that's why I break them." I explore technology,
I frequent Asian and Italian cuisine, spend time with my family, and pick up heavy things.
I make a conscious effort to find time for writing, playing video games, and daydreaming.</p>

<p>It is my intention to leverage this blogging space as a way to engage multiple communities
and discuss a variety of topics that I am passionate about. Much of my career has had tactical
or military application, so many of my blog posts will be framed in that context. This
blog will hopefully evolve into a creative outlet that explores more than "DoD-centric" material.
</p>

<p>Some topics I intend to explore, as I can:</p>
<ul class="topic-list">
	<li>Cyber Threat Intelligence [CTI]</li>
	<li>Red Team Methodology, Beyond Pentesting</li>
	<li>The Intricacies of Privacy & Anonymity</li>
	<li>Mental Health in an Overwhelming World</li>
	<li>Opportunities for Giving Back to the Community</li>
	<li>Malware && Code</li>
	<li>RF, SDR, and the Black Magic Inbetween</li>
	<li>Literature and Books w/ Solid Lessons</li>
	<li>Whatever else I feel like tossing into the ring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheers,<br>
 - CHz</p>

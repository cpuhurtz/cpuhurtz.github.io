description: Rough overview of the disassembly of a Baofeng UV-5R, followed by the extraction of its IC-resident firmware.

## Summary:

Prolific within the intersection between amateur radio and civilian tactical groups, the Baofeng UV-5R is an exceptional first choice for anyone trying to understand programmable radios and their application within the field. I rarely use mine, if at all, so I figured it's better suited in the queue for teardown.

## Disassembly

I don't take credit for the [disassembly][1] video; it was particularly useful for tearing down the coax port / feed line; prior to removing the UV-5R's face, various header components had to be removed or at least loosened in order for me to have access to the board. I resorted to using an iFixit Precision Toolkit which was more than enough for my purposes. I recommend following this video to the 'T' if you intend on reassembling the radio; my method was clumsy at best, so a couple of components (namely the coax and LED) were slightly bent, but not horrifically so. Successful disassembly roughly results in:

* a backplate with spongy contact pads
* a rubber button cutout
* a display panel (which is situated against the plastic face cover for data display)
* at least 16 screws (four various sizes, depending on mounting point)
* a volume dial
* butt plate (also plastic in composition)
* a speaker which is glued to the front face of the radio
* a wire which is soldered between the spearker and contact patches on the circuit board
* and the circuit board itself ...

A lot of this is stuff you can find on forums across the internet, ranging from RU to JP.

## Summary:

Prolific within the intersection between amateur radio and civilian tactical groups, the Baofeng UV-5R is an exceptional first choice for anyone trying to understand programmable radios and their application within the field. I rarely use mine, if at all, so I figured it's better suited in the queue for teardown.
